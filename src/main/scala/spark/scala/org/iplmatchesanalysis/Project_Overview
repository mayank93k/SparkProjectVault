OVERVIEW:: 
------------------------
In this project, We have to perform analysis on the IPL dataset and derive some important primitives from it like which 
stadium is most suitable for batting first and bowling first along with the winning percentage of each stadium for batting 
and bowling first.

UseCase:
  Case1.Which stadium is best suitable for first batting
  Case2.No of matches that each stadium has been venued 
  Case3.The winning percentage of each stadium for first_bat_won
  Case4.Which stadium is best suitable for first Bowling 
  Case5.The total of number of matches each stadium has venued(same as case 2)
  Case6.The winning percentage of each stadium for bowl_first_won

Inputfile: iplmatch.csv
Outputfile: Case1_output.txt
            Case2_output.txt
            Case3_output.txt
            Case4_output.txt
            Case5_output.txt
            Case6_output.txt
            
=> When we take the list of stadiums, the top 4 stadiums with the highest first bat win percentage venued all have below 20 matches. 
But in Chidambaram stadium there held total 48 matches out of 30 match won by side batting first. When we take that streak, 
we can deduce that Ma Chidambaram Stadium is most suitable(Rank 1 if we consider atleast 20 matches is played on that ground) 
for first batting in the IPL.

=>Green park stands is in the first place but the number of matches held there was only 2 but the total number of matches held 
at Eden gardens were 40, out of 40 matches 32 matches won by bowling first. So if we take that winning streak, 
Eden gardens is most suitable for bowling first.
